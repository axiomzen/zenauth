This project was generated by [hatch](https://github.com/axiomzen/hatch)

#### Simple Workflow ####

1. Make changes
2. `go install`
3. `ginkgo test/integration`
4. If you need a new dependency, use `glide get github.com/whatever/dude` (this will add it to your `glide.yml` file for you)

#### Migrations ####

To create a new sql migration file, do the following:
- `go get github.com/mattes/migrate`
- `cd data/migrations`
- `migrate -url postgres://postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable create whatever` (migrate just needs to be able to reach some postgres db in order to figure out the appropriate extension (`.sql`))
- Edit the up and down files at will
